    <h2>Part One: Solidify Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        HTTP is an acronym for Hyper Text Transfer Protocal. This is how
        computers talk to servers to retrieve information. This governs how
        clients get data from, or send data to a server.
      </li>
      <li>
        A URL is a uniform Resource Locater and supplies the request
        information/ address a user is trying to reach.
      </li>
      <li>
        DNS (Domain Name System) is the naming system used to reach and ID
        computers through the internet. System that takes human readable URL's
        and converts them into IP addresses.
      </li>
      <li>
        A query string is a "search" attribute added to the URL used to filter
        for intformation specifically queried. Using key-value pairs, format
        ?key1=value1&key2=value2...
      </li>
      <li>
        The HTTP verb "GET" is retrieving information and is not impacting
        /altering the server otherwise. The verb "POST" is impacting the server.
      </li>
      <li>
        An HTTP response is a response from the server (using HTTP protocal)
        after recieing "GET" commands. A response varies based on the request,
        an example can simply be returning the HTML page upon a user searching
        for the home page.
      </li>
      <li>
        An HTTP header provides additional informationabout the request or the
        response. For instance, request headers: accept, cookies, cache-control.
        A response header includse content-type, last-modified-, cahce-control.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS Your
        browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info
        about browser, any previous cookies, and other things) The server sends
        a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was
        sucessful) The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other
        resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc) The browser makes
        separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from
        the server for each request.
      </li>
    </ul>
